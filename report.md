I import pandas and read the .csv file
I do print(df.head()) to show the first few rows of data
I do print(df.info()) to display basic info about the dataset
I do print(df.columns) to show what kind of categories that are in the dataset
i then identify codex-related columns in lines 12 and 13
lines 15-17 show the frequency of different values
lines 19-21 show the most common values
